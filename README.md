"# color-game" 

Inspired by udemy course https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/3861466#overview


# Todo
- use <button> for controls
- create init() function that runs all from start
- init should just call functions (should not contain much code)
- consider splitting up code in more functions (all >10 lines)
- outline: none to avoid surrounding blue line of objects
- add loop through buttons (for more levels) class to add eventlisteners
- create reset() function to update #cubes,...
- use ternary operator if ? then : else (for 2 options useful)
- add letter-spacing: 1px for controls
- loop through all squares and only show / set color if color[i] exist
- font-size: inherit for controls
- span between buttons to show message: display inline-block and width 20% creates gap
- add height: 100% to button to ensure it takes 100% of parent element (not just the line height)
- hover button effect
- fade: transition all 0.5s for button / background 0.6 for square
- fade out wrong color
- display 'correct / wrong' instead of alert
- show rgb of wrong selection to learn
- write 'try again' instead of 'start game' after first try
- re-style differently
- implement correct math.random (code 
bottom of js)
- extract more into single functions (eg math.random)
- avoid global variables and move into functions and return values from function

## Outlook
- transition of appearing cubes
- deploy
- google analytics
- add advertising
- PWA
- consider line-height in styling
